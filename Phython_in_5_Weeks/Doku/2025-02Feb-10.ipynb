    "\n",
    "Back in the early days of computers, if you had a problem to solve, you created a computer to solve it. If you had another problem to solve, you created a new, separate computer to solve it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pretty soon, it became clear that we should have a general-purpose computer that we can reconfigure and change to solve many different problems. The way that we would tell this computer what to do was with binary digits (bits), 1s and 0s.\n",
    "\n",
    "The good news? This worked!\n",
    "\n",
    "The bad news? It was very hard to write programs in this way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pretty soon after that, people created *programming languages*. The idea is that we write our instructions in something that looks like English, but is translated into 1s and 0s for the computer's benefit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is one of hundreds of thousands of different programming languages. Each has its own advantages and disadvantages. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Python is not very fast to execute, relative to other languages\n",
    "- But Python is *very* fast to write, read (understand), and debug/maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a great language for an age in which computers are cheap and people are expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "- C is a very fast-to-execute language, but very complex and hard for most people, because it is \"low level,\" working much like the computer things/acts.\n",
    "- Java is higher level than C and also executes quickly, but still requires you keep track of more things than Python.\n",

    "# Where is Python used?\n",

    "- Top language for data science and machine learning\n",

    "- Devops and server configuration\n",
    "- APIs\n",
    "- Education\n",

    "Python is not used where speed is of the essence -- writing operating systems. Also, it's very weak in mobile applications now.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is also an *open-source* language, which means that is not owned by any corporation. It's owned by a non-profit (the Python Software Foundation) which ensures that the development is all done by the community."

    "If you're going to write Python code, you can (and this is the norm) create a text file with a `.py` suffix containing Python code, and then run it. However, this means installing Python and an editor (two typical ones are VSCode and PyCharm), and then executing from inside of there.\n",
    "\n",
    "The O'Reilly site has some videos I made telling you how to install Python and get VSCode working.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, I like to use Jupyter, which gives the illusion of running Python in your browser. The code is really running on a server somewhere (in this case, on my computer), but shows its results in the browser.\n",
